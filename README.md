# Letter Boxed Solution Finder

The New York Times puzzle page has become a fun family challenge for my family. It has become a small challenge to see who can find the best words to solve the puzzles. 

That had me thinking that perhaps I could create a tool to 'help' find the best words to solve the puzzle.

This is an attempt to create such a tool. 

If I can successfully create the tool that offers word suggestions, I cannot be sure the suggested words will actually be in the Letter Boxed dictionary.

But it will be fun to try :-)

This will be a fun app to practice using only front-side (user computer power) and I assume search algorithms to find word matches.
